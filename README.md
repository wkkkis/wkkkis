## About me
Software Engineer focused on React, Next.js, Python and Node.js.

At Bookinglane, integrated Stripe and optimized Core Web Vitals - improving site speed by
30% and boosting organic traffic that grew revenue 8× through better SEO performance.

At ATLABY TE, built AI-driven tools for image generation and fraud detection that cut

I love clean UI, performance, and learning how small improvements can make a big difference.

improving.
