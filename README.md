## About me
Full‑stack engineer focused on TypeScript, React/Next.js, React Native (Expo), and Node on AWS.  
I’ve shipped products for media, booking, and crypto, led small teams, migrated legacy codebases, and integrated LLM features (chat, retrieval, assistants). Recently moved to the U.S. and actively polish my English while building.

**Core strengths**
- Product‑minded engineering: deliver features end‑to‑end with measurable impact
- Architecture & performance: SSR/ISR, caching, queues, observability, CI/CD
- AI integrations: RAG/pgvector, tool calling, content generation, in‑app assistants

**Tech**
`TypeScript` · `React` · `Next.js` · `React Native / Expo` · `Node.js` · `Postgres` · `Prisma` · `Redis` · `AWS (S3, CloudFront, Lambda)` · `Docker` · `Playwright/Vitest` · `shadcn/ui` · `OpenAI`

## Engineering notes
- **Testing & quality:** Vitest/Playwright, eslint/prettier, Husky, strict TS.
- **Infra:** Docker Compose for local dev; IaC coming soon; observability hooks.
- **Docs:** each repo has a concise README (goal, stack, architecture, runbook).
